  abstract = {The {MTw} Awinda is the second generation wireless inertial-magnetic motion tracker by Xsens. The {MTw} enables real-time 3D kinematic applications with multiple motion trackers by providing highly accurate orientation through an unobtrusive setup. This whitepaper presents the basic working principles and architecture of the Xsens {MTw} Awinda system. Furthermore, the system performance is assessed and key outcomes of two reallife experiments using the Xsens {MTw} Awinda system are given. In the ﬁrst experiment the performance during arm movements related to sports and gaming is evaluated, while the second experiment focuses on data acquired during walking and running, including exposure to magnetic distortions for extended periods of time. The results show that {MTw} Awinda is a ﬂexible, easyto-use, and reliable tool for capturing human motion in a large variety of applications, even in challenging environments.},

Measures of center of pressure ({COP}) dynamics (how regular or predictable were the {COP} data as quantiﬁed by the sample entropy metric) and variability (as quantiﬁed by the {COP} standard deviation) were obtained from a sample of children with {CP} (n = 30) and compared to the same measures taken from typically developing ({TD}) children. Children with {CP} demonstrated an apparent inefﬁciency in postural control (greater irregularity, greater sway variability) relative to {TD} peers during a quietstance (no supra-postural task) condition (p {\textless} .05). During supra-postural task performance, those differences were attenuated, though they remained statistically different (p {\textless} .05). The ﬁndings illustrate ﬂexibility and adaptability in the postural control system, despite the pathological features associated with {CP}.},

The {ML} center of mass ({CoM}) position during treadmill walking can be estimated based on kinematic data (marker-based method) and a combination of ground reaction forces and center of pressure positions ({GRF}-based method). Here, we compare a {GRF}-based method with a full-body marker-based method for estimating the {ML} {CoM}, {ML} {XCoM} and {ML} {MoS}. Fifteen healthy adults walked on a dual-belt treadmill at comfortable walking speed for three minutes. Kinetic and kinematic data were collected and analyzed using a {GRF}-based and marker-based method to compare the {ML} {CoM}, {ML} {XCoM} and {ML} {MoS}. High correlation coefficients (r {\textgreater} 0.98) and small differences (Root Mean Square Difference {\textless} 0.0072 m) in {ML} {CoM} and {ML} {XCoM} were found between the {GRF}-based and marker-based methods. The {GRF}-based method resulted in larger {ML} {XCoM} excursion (0.0118 ± 0.0074 m) and smaller {ML} {MoS} values (0.0062 ± 0.0028 m) than the marker-based method, but these differences were consistent across participants. In conclusion, the {GRF}-based method is a valid method to determine the {ML} {CoM}, {XCoM} and {MoS}. One should be aware of higher {ML} {XCoM} and smaller {ML} {MoS} values in the {GRF}-based method when comparing absolute values between studies. The {GRF}-based method strongly reduces measurement times and can be used to provide real-time {CoM}-{CoP} feedback during treadmill gait training.},

Here, we examined the effects of augmenting cholinergic neurotransmission on static and dynamic balance, indices of fall risk.
                  Methods: A single-site, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial examined the effect of donepezil in patients with {PD}. Forty-nine participants with idiopathic {PD} were randomized and 45 completed the trial. Each treatment period was 6 weeks with a 6-week washout between treatments. Donepezil in 2.5 mg capsules, or identical appearing placebo capsules, was increased from two per day (5 mg) to four capsules (10 mg) after 3 weeks. The primary outcome measures were the range of the medio-lateral sway when standing (static balance) and the variability of the stride duration when walking (dynamic balance). A linear mixed model was used to investigate whether the change in outcomes between weeks 0 and 6 differed between phases.
                  Results: There were no significant differences in treatment effects between placebo and donepezil for mediolateral sway range during quiet standing (p = 0.28), nor in gait variability (p = 0.31). None of the secondary outcome measures or exploratory analyses were significant although one secondary measure of static balance was increased by donepezil.
                  Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, cholinergic augmentation with donepezil at 10 mg/day for 6 weeks did not affect measures of static or dynamic balance in people with {PD}. These results are compared with other phase 2 trials of cholinesterase inhibitors and considerations for future trials are discussed.},

This cross-sectional study explored older-adults’ gait kinematics and their kinematic adaptations to different walking speeds, with the purpose of identifying mechanisms that might be related to increased risk for falls. Fifty-eight older adults from self-care residential facilities walked on a treadmill, whose velocity was systematically increased with increments of 0.1 meters/second (m/s) from 0.5 to 0.9 m/s, and then similarly decreased. Thorax, pelvis, trunk, arms, and legs angular total range of motion ({tROM}), stride time, stride length, and step width were measured. Twenty-one of the subjects reported falling, and 37 didn’t fall. No signiﬁcant effect of a fall history was found for any of the dependent variables. A marginally signiﬁcant interaction effect of fall history and walking speed was found for arms’ {tROM} (p = 0.098). Speed had an effect on many of the measures for both groups. As the treadmill’s velocity increased, the non-fallers increased their arm (15.9 8.6 to 26.6 12.7 ) and trunk rotations (4.7 1.9 to 7.2 2.8 ) {tROM}, whereas for the fallers the change of arm (14.7 14.8 to 20.8 13 ) and trunk (5.5 2.9 to 7.3 2.3 ) rotations {tROM} were moderate between the different walking speeds. We conclude that walking speed manipulation exposed different ﬂexibility trends. Only non-fallers demonstrated the ability to adapt trunk and arm {ROM} to treadmill speed i.e., had a more ﬂexible pattern of behavior for arm and trunk motions, supporting the upper-body’s importance for stability while walking.},

Our aim was to identify if postural control deﬁcits and gait dysfunction progress differently in freezers compared to non-freezers and whether this relates to {FOG} development.
                  Methods: 76 {PD} patients, classiﬁed as freezer (n ¼ 17) or non-freezer (n ¼ 59), and 24 controls underwent a gait and postural control assessments at baseline and after 12 months follow-up. Non-freezers who developed {FOG} during the study period were categorized as {FOG} converters (n ¼ 5). Gait was analyzed during walking at self-preferred pace. Postural control was assessed using the Mini-{BESTest} and its sub-categories: sensory orientation, anticipatory, reactive and dynamic postural control.
                  Results: Mini-{BESTest} scores were lower in {PD} compared to controls (p {\textless} 0.001), and in freezers compared to non-freezers (p ¼ 0.02). {PD} has worse anticipatory (p ¼ 0.01), reactive (p ¼ 0.02) and dynamic postural control (p ¼ 0.003) compared to controls. Freezers scored lower on dynamic postural control compared to non-freezers (p ¼ 0.02). There were no baseline differences between converters and non-converters. Decline in postural control was worse in {PD} compared to controls (p ¼ 0.02) as shown by a greater decrease in the total Mini-{BESTest} score. Similar patterns were found in freezers (p ¼ 0.006), who also showed more decline in anticipatory (p {\textless} 0.001) and dynamic postural control (p ¼ 0.02) compared to non-freezers. {FOG} converters had a greater decline in the total Mini-{BESTest} (p ¼ 0.005) and dynamic postural control scores (p ¼ 0.04) compared to non-converters. Gait outcomes showed no signiﬁcant differences in any of the analyses.
                  Conclusion: {FOG} is associated with more severe decline in postural control, which can be detected by the clinical Mini-{BESTest}.},

  abstract     = {Older adults use a diﬀerent muscle strategy to cope with postural instability, in which they ‘co-contract’ the muscles around the ankle joint. It has been suggested that this is a compensatory response to age-related proprioceptive decline however this view has never been assessed directly. The current study investigated the association between proprioceptive acuity and muscle co-contraction in older adults. We compared muscle activity, by recording surface electromyography ({EMG}) from the bilateral tibialis anterior ({TA}) and gastrocnemius medialis ({GM}) muscles, in young (aged 18–34) and older adults (aged 65–82) during postural assessment on a ﬁxed and sway-referenced surface at age-equivalent levels of sway. We performed correlations between muscle activity and proprioceptive acuity, which was assessed using an active contralateral matching task. Despite successfully inducing similar levels of sway in the two age groups, older adults still showed higher muscle co-contraction. A stepwise regression analysis showed that proprioceptive acuity measured using variable error was the best predictor of muscle co-contraction in older adults. However, despite suggestions from previous research, proprioceptive error and muscle co-contraction were negatively correlated in older adults, suggesting that better proprioceptive acuity predicts more co-contraction. Overall, these results suggest that although muscle co-contraction may be an age-speciﬁc strategy used by older adults, it is not to compensate for age-related proprioceptive deﬁcits. Ó 2016 {IBRO}.

The other two classes in the classiﬁcation task are frail and robust (non-frail). To achieve this, a dataset based on gait was utilized, which was recorded by an Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}) sensor, including gyroscope and accelerometer data. In this study, two approaches were assessed: the ﬁrst used advanced Deep Learning ({DL}) algorithms to analyze raw {IMU} signals, and the second used conventional Machine Learning ({ML}) methods with hand-crafted features. The {DL} model, i.e., {InceptionTime}, beat the other algorithms in the {DL} approach with a remarkable test accuracy of 98\%. On the {ML} side, Random Forest reported the most successful {ML} method, which achieved a test accuracy of 63.3\%. For a careful assessment of the models, other evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score were also evaluated. The evaluation of both approaches produces research beneﬁts for the classiﬁcation of frailty in older people and allows for the investigation of new areas, promoting deeper comprehension and well-informed decision-making, particularly in healthcare systems.},

This study investigates two tests from the Neurological Functional Tests Suite ({NeuFun}-{TS}) smartphone application, the “Postural Sway” and “Pronator Drift” tests. These tests capture different domains of postural control and motoric dysfunction in healthy volunteers (n = 13) and people with neurological disorders (n = 68 relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis [{MS}]; n = 21 secondary progressive {MS}; n = 23 primary progressive {MS}; n = 13 other inflammatory neurological diseases; n = 21 non-inflammatory neurological diseases; n = 4 clinically isolated syndrome; n = 1 radiologically isolated syndrome). Smartphone accelerometer data was transformed into digital biomarkers, which were filtered in the training cohort ({\textasciitilde} 80\% of subjects) for test–retest reproducibility and correlations with subdomains of neurological examinations and validated imaging biomarkers. The independent validation cohort ({\textasciitilde} 20\%) determined whether biomarker models outperformed the best single digital biomarkers. Postural sway acceleration magnitude in the eyes closed and feet together stance demonstrated the highest reliability ({ICC} = 0.706), strongest correlations with age (Pearson r {\textless}= 0.82) and clinical and imaging outcomes (r {\textless}= 0.65, p {\textless} 0.001) and stronger predictive value for sway-relevant neurological disability outcomes than models that aggregated multiple biomarkers (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.46 vs 0.38). The pronator drift test only captured cerebellar dysfunction, had less reproducible biomarkers, but provided additive value when combined with postural sway biomarkers into models predicting global scales of neurological disability. In conclusion, a simple 1-min postural sway test accurately measures body oscillations that increase with natural aging and differentiates them from abnormally increased body oscillations in people with neurological disabilities.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the meaning of successful living has moved from extending lifetime to improving the quality of aging, mainly in terms of high cognitive and physical functioning together with avoiding diseases. In healthy elderly, falls represent an alarming accident both in terms of number of events and the consequent decrease in the quality of life. Stability control is a key approach for studying the genesis of falls, for detecting the event and trying to develop methodologies to prevent it. Wearable sensors have proved to be very useful in monitoring and analyzing the stability of subjects. Within this manuscript, a review of the approaches proposed in the literature for fall risk assessment, fall prevention and fall detection in healthy elderly is provided. The review has been carried out by using the most adopted publication databases and by deﬁning a search strategy based on keywords and boolean algebra constructs. The analysis aims at evaluating the state of the art of such kind of monitoring, both in terms of most adopted sensor technologies and of their location on the human body. The review has been extended to both dynamic and static analyses. In order to provide a useful tool for researchers involved in this ﬁeld, the manuscript also focuses on the tests conducted in the analyzed studies, mainly in terms of characteristics of the population involved and of the tasks used. Finally, the main trends related to sensor typology, sensor location and tasks have been identiﬁed.},

Monitoring behavioral changes in real life may offer opportunities for the early identiﬁcation of frailty before clinical visits. This study presented a sensor-based system that used heterogeneous sensors and cloud technologies to monitor behavioral and physical signs of frailty from home settings. We aimed to validate the concurrent validity of the sensor measurements. The sensor system consisted of multiple types of ambient sensors, a smart speaker, and a smart weight scale. The selection of these sensors was based on behavioral and physical signs associated with frailty. Older adults’ perspectives were also included in the system design. The sensor system prototype was tested in a simulated home lab environment with nine young, healthy participants. Cohen’s Kappa and Bland–Altman Plot were used to evaluate the agreements between the sensor and ground truth measurements. Excellent concurrent validity was achieved for all sensors except for the smart weight scale. The bivariate correlation between the smart and traditional weight scales showed a strong, positive correlation between the two measurements (r = 0.942, n = 24, p {\textless} 0.001). Overall, this work showed that the Frailty Toolkit ({FT}) is reliable for monitoring physical and behavioral signs of frailty in home settings.},

  abstract = {Traditional assessments of balance and postural control often face challenges related to accessibility, cost, subjectivity, and inter-rater reliability. With advancements in technology, smartphones equipped with inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) are emerging as a promising tool for assessing postural control, measuring both static and dynamic motion. This study aimed to develop and validate a novel smartphone application by comparing it with research-grade posturography instruments, including motion capture and force plate systems to establish construct- and criterion-related validity. Twenty-two participants completed the quiet stance under varying visual (eyes open—{EO}; eyes closed—{EC}) and surface (Firm vs. Foam) conditions, with data collected from the smartphone, force plate, and motion capture systems. Intraclass correlation coefficients ({ICCs}) and Pearson correlation coefficients assessed the reliability and validity for all outcome measures (sway area and sway velocity). The results demonstrated reliability, with strong validity between the devices. A repeated-measures {ANOVA} found no significant differences between the devices. Postural outcomes revealed the significant main effects of both the visual ({EO} vs. {EC}) and surface (Firm vs. Foam) conditions. In conclusion, the study demonstrated the validity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the custom-designed smartphone app, offering the potential for bridging the gap between at-home and clinical balance assessments.},

Indirect probes (i.e., mental imagery) of brain involvement support the role of prefrontal cortex as a key cortical region for postural control in older adults with and without Parkinsonian syndromes. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy ({fNIRs}) as a direct online cortical probe, this study aimed to compare neural activation patterns in prefrontal cortex, postural stability, and their respective interactions, in (1) patients with Parkinsonian syndromes; (2) those with mild parkinsonian signs; (3) and healthy older adults. Among 269 non-demented older adults (76.4176.70 years, 56\% women), 26 individuals presented with Parkinsonian syndromes (Uniﬁed Parkinson’s disease rating scale ({UPDRS}): 11.0873.60), 117 had mild parkinsonian signs ({UPDRS}: 3.2172.49), and 126 individuals were included as a healthy control group. Participants were asked to stand upright and count silently for ten seconds while changes in oxygenated hemoglobin levels over prefrontal cortex were measured using {fNIRs}. We simultaneously evaluated postural stability with center of pressure velocity data recorded on an instrumented walkway. Compared to healthy controls and patients with mild parkinsonian signs, patients with Parkinsonian syndromes demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher prefrontal oxygenation levels to maintain postural stability. The pattern of brain activation and postural control of participants with mild parkinsonian signs were similar to that of normal controls. These ﬁndings highlight the online role of the prefrontal cortex in postural control in patients with Parkinsonian syndromes and afford the opportunity to improve therapeutic options for postural instability.},

  abstract   = {Laboratory-based assessments of standing posture provide important insights into balance, mobility, and many other factors. We created a smartphone-based assessment of standing posture—completed with the phone placed in the user’s pocket—for use in remote, non-laboratory settings. We here tested the reliability and sensitivity of App-derived metrics of postural sway to participant age and standing condition. Fifteen healthy younger and 15 older adults completed two laboratory visits separated by one week. On each visit, they followed multi-media instructions provided by the App to complete three 30-second trials each of standing with eyes open ({EO}), eyes closed ({EC}), and eyes open while performing a serial subtraction dual task ({DT}). Sway data were simultaneously collected with the App and a gold-standard force plate. Participants also completed App-based tests within their own homes on three separate days. To characterize sway, path length and root-mean-square ({RMS}) were derived from the acceleration and angular velocity signal acquired from the phone’s internal motion sensor, and from the center of pressure ({COP}) signal acquired by the force plate. Across repeated trials conducted on the same day within the laboratory, App-derived path length and {RMS} of acceleration and angular velocity across conditions demonstrated moderate to excellent test-retest reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ({ICCs})=0.69–0.97) for both the younger and older adults. Force platederived metrics demonstrated low to excellent test-retest reliability ({ICCs}=0.44–0.93). Compared to within-day laboratory testing, App-derived sway outcomes generally exhibited greater variability when tested across days within the home ({ICCs}=0.14–0.79). All sway metrics derived from the App were sensitive to age group (F{\textgreater}43.8, p{\textless}0.001) and task condition (F{\textgreater}31.8, p{\textless}0.001) in both laboratory and home settings. The smartphone App we created enabled reliable and sensitive assessment of standing postural sway within different task conditions, in both relatively healthy younger and older adults.},

                  Methods: A total of 296 healthy adults (65.32 ± 6.74 yrs; 83.10 \% female) were recruited. Gait assessment was performed using an {IMU} sensor-based gait analysis system, and 3D motion information of hip and knee joints was obtained using magnetic sensors. The basic characteristics of the study sample were stratified by age category, and the baseline characteristics between the groups were compared using analysis of variance ({ANOVA}). Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between age as the dependent variable and several measures of gait parameters and joint angles as independent variables.
                  Results: The results of this study found that there were significant differences in gait velocity and both terminal double support in the three groups according to age, and statistically significant differences in the three groups in hip joint angle and knee joints angle. In addition, it was found that the gait velocity and knee/hip joint angle changed with age, and the gait velocity and knee/hip joint angle were also different in the elderly and adult groups.

  abstract     = {Introduction: Falls and gait disorders often result in hospitalization and immobilization. Near-falls may be one of the earliest signs of increased fall risk. In the literature, several sensor positions are used for fall detection, but few studies include the head as a sensor position. Hearables and hearing aids are increasingly equipped with inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) and are therefore of particular interest for measuring the risk of falling in everyday life.
                  Methods: Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the ear as a sensor position for near-fall detection in comparison to the standard sensor positions. The motion data of one study participant (female, 63 years) was exemplary analyzed. The participant walked at her individually preferred gait speed on a perturbation treadmill while nine different perturbations (anterior-posterior, medio-lateral and pitch) were applied with a time interval of 20-30 seconds. We used seven {IMUs} during the measurement at the positions ear, sternum, lumbar, wrist (left/right), foot (left/right).
                  Results: The absolute acceleration signals at the seven different positions show the periodicity of the normal gait before the perturbation. During and after the perturbation changes in the motion pattern can be seen, whereby the response to the perturbation occurs with a slight time lag. The Pearson correlations show that the sensor positions sternum, lumbar and ear correlate well with each other and thus show similar signal characteristics in the reaction to this perturbation.
                  Conclusion: This provides evidence that the ear sensor position is at least comparable to the preferred sensor positions in the literature on the torso. However, these results were obtained under laboratory conditions. Further research is needed to investigate the sensor position at the ear in everyday life.},

                  Methods: We conducted two separate studies with two groups of subjects. Study I: sensitivity and experimental concurrent validity. Thirteen subjects with early, untreated Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) and 12 age-matched control subjects ({CTR}) were tested in the laboratory, to compare sway from force-plate {COP} and inertial sensors. Study {II}: test-retest reliability and clinical concurrent validity. A different set of 17 early-to-moderate, treated {PD} (tested {ON} medication), and 17 age-matched {CTR} subjects were tested in the clinic to compare clinical balance tests with sway from inertial sensors. For reliability, the sensor was removed, subjects rested for 30 min, and the protocol was repeated. Thirteen sway measures (7 time-domain, 5 frequency-domain measures, and {JERK}) were computed from the 2D time series acceleration ({ACC}) data to determine the best metrics for a clinical balance test.
                  Results: Both center of pressure ({COP}) and {ACC} measures differentiated sway between {CTR} and untreated {PD}. {JERK} and time-domain measures showed the best test-retest reliability ({JERK} {ICC} was 0.86 in {PD} and 0.87 in {CTR}; time-domain measures {ICC} ranged from 0.55 to 0.84 in {PD} and from 0.60 to 0.89 in {CTR}). {JERK}, all but one time-domain measure, and one frequency measure were significantly correlated with the clinical postural stability score (r ranged from 0.50 to 0.63, 0.01 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.05).
                  Conclusions: Based on these results, we recommend a subset of the most sensitive, reliable, and valid {ISway} measures to characterize posture control in {PD}: 1) {JERK}, 2) {RMS} amplitude and mean velocity from the time-domain measures, and 3) centroidal frequency as the best frequency measure, as valid and reliable measures of balance control from {ISway}.},

  abstract     = {Dual-task ({DT}) gait involves walking while simultaneously performing an attention-demanding task and can be used to identify impaired gait or executive function in older adults. Advancment is needed in techniques that quantify the inﬂuence of dual tasking to improve predictive and diagnostic potential. This study investigated the viability of wearable sensor measures to identify {DT} gait changes in older adults and distinguish between elderly fallers and non-fallers. A convenience sample of 100 older individuals (75.5 7 6.7 years; 76 non-fallers, 24 fallers based on 6 month retrospective fall occurrence) walked 7.62 m under single-task ({ST}) and {DT} conditions while wearing pressure-sensing insoles and triaxial accelerometers at the head, pelvis, and left and right shanks. Differences between {ST} and {DT} gait were identiﬁed for temporal measures, acceleration descriptive statistics, Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}) quartiles, ratio of even to odd harmonics, center of pressure ({CoP}) stance path coefﬁcient of variation, and deviations to expected {CoP} stance path. Increased posterior {CoP} stance path deviations, increased coefﬁcient of variation, decreased {FFT} quartiles, and decreased ratio of even to odd harmonics suggested increased {DT} gait variability. Decreased gait velocity and decreased acceleration standard deviations ({SD}) at the pelvis and shanks could represent compensatory gait strategies that maintain stability. Differences in acceleration between fallers and non-fallers in head posterior {SD} and pelvis {AP} ratio of even to odd harmonics during {ST}, and pelvis vertical maximum Lyapunov exponent during {DT} gait were identiﬁed. Wearable-sensor-based {DT} gait assessments could be used in point-of-care environments to identify gait deﬁcits.},

  abstract     = {Postural control relies on the integration of inputs from the visual, somatosensory and vestibular systems which are frequently impaired in people with Multiple Sclerosis ({PwMS}). In this situation, examining the Romberg ratio can be useful. This parameter can be interpreted as a gross indicator of a vestibular and proprioceptive contribution to postural control. Therefore, the primary objective of the current study was to examine whether the Romberg ratio differs between {MS} fallers, non-fallers and neurological disability levels. In addition, we clariﬁed the association between the Romberg ratio values with validated gait and the balance tests in {PwMS}. Romberg ratio values were calculated according to the sway rate, total sway area and center of pressure ({CoP}) path length. The patient group included 542 {PwMS} (337 women) with a mean age of 42.3 (S.D = 13.8). In terms of fall status, signiﬁcant differences were observed between the faller (n = 287) and non-faller (n = 255) groups solely in terms of the Romberg ratio-ellipse sway area: 2.76 (S.D = 2.46) vs. 2.24 (S.D = 2.01), P-value = 0.01. A signiﬁcant increase in the Romberg ratio was found between the severe group (n = 50), the very mild (n = 245), mild (n = 186) and moderate (n = 61) groups for each of the three Romberg ratio quotients. Signiﬁcant weak correlation scores were found between the Romberg ratio-ellipse sway area and all walking and balance outcome measures; the Pearson’s rho ranged from 0.172 to 0.270. The present data suggest that an elevated Romberg ratio quotient, especially according to the sway area, is an indicator of poor walking and balance capabilities in {PwMS}.},
