The data for this example is located in Kaggle in the following [URL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance), but the modified file for this class is located [here](../../data/insurance_2.csv)

## Context of the data

The content is adapted from kaggle. 

The datasets utilized in 'Machine Learning with R' by Brett Lantz are a valuable resource for learners, providing a foundation for hands-on experience with machine learning concepts. Although Packt Publishing does not make these datasets readily available online, they can be accessed through public domain sources, requiring only minor preprocessing and formatting to match the book's specifications. This presents an opportunity for readers to engage deeply with the material, reproducing and building upon the book's examples to reinforce their understanding of machine learning principles.
